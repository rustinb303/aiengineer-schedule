      "description": "Don't be intimidated. Modern AI can feel like magic, but underneath the hood are principles that web developers can understand, even if you don't have a machine learning background. In this workshop, we'll explore a complete GPT-2 inference implementation built entirely in Vanilla JS. This JavaScript translation of the popular \"Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need\" approach will let you debug and step through a real LLM line by line without the overhead of learning a new language, framework, or even IDE.\r\n\r\nAll the major LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Llama, inherit from GPT-2's architecture, making this exploration a solid foundation to understand modern AI systems and comprehend the latest research.\r\n\r\nWhile we won't have time to cover *everything*, you'll gain the essential knowledge to understand the key concepts that matter when building with LLMs, including how they:\r\n\r\n-Convert raw text into meaningful tokens\r\n- Represent semantic meaning through vector embeddings\r\n- Train neural networks through gradient descent\r\n- Generate text with sampling algorithms like top-k, top-p, and temperature\r\n\r\nThis intense but beginner-friendly workshop is designed specifically for web developers diving into ML and AI for the first time. It’s your \"missing AI degree\" in just two hours. You'll walk away with an intuitive mental model of how Transformers work that you can apply immediately to your own LLM-powered projects.",

It turns out that getting AI to click, type, and scroll is more challenging than getting it to generate code. How can we build general-purpose agents that can do anything we can do on a computer? \r\n\r\nThis is our goal at the Amazon AGI SF Lab. In this talk, I’ll propose a new approach to agents that we call Useful General Intelligence. After describing how we’re solving the biggest challenges in computer use while enabling developers to access our tech in it’s earliest developmental stages, I’ll show real workflows that developers have built with Nova Act, our agentic model and SDK.

In our talk, we introduce a novel approach integrating Knowledge Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) with VectorRAG, designed to refine question-answering (Q&A) systems for more effective information extraction from complex texts. Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.",

They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

I've been hacking on AI agents for a while.\r\n\r\nI've tried every agent framework out there, from the plug-and-play crew/langchains to the \"minimalist\" smolagents of the world to the \"production grade\" langraph, griptape, etc.\r\n\r\nI've talked to a lot of really strong founders who are all building really impressive things with AI. Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don't see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.\r\n\r\nI've been surprised to find that most of the products out there billing themselves as \"AI Agents\" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.\r\n\r\nAgents, at least the good ones, don't follow the \"here's your prompt, here's a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal\" pattern. Rather, they are comprised of mostly just software.\r\n\r\nSo, I set out to answer:\r\n\r\nWhat are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?\r\n",

      "description": "AI-powered agents promise faster, easier software delivery, but their unpredictable behavior often makes engineers hesitant to fully trust them with critical workflows. Sam Alba, Co-founder of Dagger (and previously co-creator of Docker), explains how teams can reliably integrate agents into their delivery pipelines by shifting how they structure and manage automation.\r\n\r\nHe'll share four practical strategies learned from real-world experience:\r\n\r\n1. Treat agents as workflow participants, not isolated tools.\r\nStop using agents as disconnected scripts or IDE plugins. Treating them as first-class parts of your delivery process simplifies your architecture, reduces hidden complexity, and makes agent outcomes more predictable.\r\n\r\n2. Use many small agents instead of one big one.\r\nJust as software evolved from monoliths to microservices, software delivery benefits from smaller, specialized agents with clearly defined responsibilities. Smaller agents are easier to understand, maintain, and integrate.\r\n\r\n3. Define clear environments—the real lever for reliability.\r\nInstead of chasing perfect prompts or models, focus on clearly defining the tools, resources, and permissions around your agents. Precisely controlling their environments makes agents behave consistently and reliably.\r\n\r\n4. Design workflows for easy debugging and observability.\r\nAgents will sometimes fail unexpectedly. Sam will share simple, effective ways to build clear tracing and observability into your workflows from the start, making debugging quicker and less frustrating.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave with practical, immediately usable techniques that give you the confidence to trust AI agents in your software delivery pipelines.",

We’ll cover how to write specs for affordances instead of features, how to use AI evals as a product development tool, and how to perform User Acceptance Testing on undocumented emergent behavior. Most importantly, we’ll explore how to build trust with customers even when the answer is, truthfully, “I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nIf you’re managing AI-native products in 2025 the same way you managed web apps in 2020, you might find yourself A/B testing an agent that decided to go off and do C, D, and E all by themselves!\r\n",

You’re losing money on every query.\r\n-Not high enough output quality? Your system can’t be used for that application.\r\n\r\nA model and the inference system around it form a “token factory” associated with a Pareto frontier— a curve representing the best possible trade-offs between cost, throughput, latency and quality, outside of which your LLM system cannot be applied successfully. \r\n\r\nOutside of the Pareto frontier? You’re back to square one.\r\nThat is, unless you’re able to change the shape of the Pareto frontier.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll introduce NVIDIA Dynamo, a datacenter-scale distributed inference framework as well as the bleeding-edge techniques it enables to hack the Pareto frontier of your inference systems, including:\r\n\r\n-Disaggregation - separating phases of LLM generation to make them more efficient\r\n-Speculation - predicting multiple tokens per cycle\r\n-KV routing, storage, and manipulation - ensuring that we don’t redo work that has already been done\r\n-Pipelining improvements for agents - accelerating our workflows using information about the agent\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, we’ll understand how the Pareto frontier limits where models can be applied, the intuition behind how inference techniques can be used to modify it, as well as the mechanics of how these techniques work.\r\n",

This lays down the foundation for the future agentic economy, where businesses will sell to autonomous agents (B2A) and eventually agents will sell to other agents (A2A).\r\n\r\nBut one key part is still missing: agents do not have a standard way to subscribe to external services and pay for them.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll show how to give agents full autonomy to discover and pay for new external MCP-enabled services, even if those services don’t support it, using a little-known MCP server nesting capability. We’ll also cover how to monetize AI agents and the B2A/A2A business models.\r\n",

The things we choose to measure become self-fulfilling prophecies, guiding AI toward specific abilities and, ultimately, defining humanity’s evolving role in the AI era. Today’s benchmarks have propelled incredible progress, but now we have an exciting opportunity: thoughtfully designing benchmarks around what genuinely matters to us—cooperation, creativity, education, and meaningful human experiences.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore how benchmarks function as powerful cultural memes, influencing not only technical outcomes but societal direction. Drawing on practical examples we have seen at Every consulting in industries like finance, journalism, education, and even personally making AI play diplomacy. We’ll uncover what makes a benchmark impactful, approachable, and inspiring. You’ll see our engaging new AI Diplomacy benchmark demo, illustrating vividly how thoughtful evaluation design can excite both engineers and the wider community.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hopefully walk away inspired and equipped to define benchmarks intentionally, helping steer AI toward outcomes that truly matter.",

      "description": "YouTube recommendations drive the majority of video watch time for billions of daily users. Traditionally powered by large embedding models (LEMs), we're undertaking a fundamental shift: rebuilding our recommendation stack using foundation models like Gemini. This talk dives into our engineering journey adapting general-purpose LLMs (Gemini) for the highly specialized, dynamic, and massive-scale task of YouTube recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a critical first step: creating a \"language\" for YouTube videos. Learn how we developed 'SemanticID', a novel tokenization scheme that distills multimodal video features (text, audio, frames) into discrete tokens representable by an LLM. Our paper (Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations) is a landmark work in this space.  \r\n\r\nWe then adapt the base Gemini checkpoint to understand sequences of these video tokens alongside natural language, effectively teaching it the grammar of user watch behavior. A key insight: unlike static LLM training, YouTube's corpus evolves so rapidly (millions of new videos daily) that daily retraining is non-negotiable to maintain recommendation quality.\r\n\r\nNow we can prompt LRM with user history and context to generate personalized candidate recommendations.\r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of attention on the LLM-led transformation of Search (with AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT-Search etc). However, across large consumer apps, it’s the recommendation systems & feeds that drive most consumer engagement, not just search. This talk is about the LLM-led transformation of recommendations & feeds – building a recommendation engine on top of Gemini.\r\n",

Learn how **containerization**, applied not just to deployment but to *each individual step* of an agent's workflow, provides the essential **isolation and environmental consistency** needed.\r\n\r\nDiscover how combining this granular container approach with patterns like immutable state management allows us to **contain agent chaos**, unlock effective testing, simplify debugging, and bring essential control and predictability back to building powerful AI agents you can actually ship with confidence.",

      "title": "Monetizing AI: From Zero to Profit",
      "description": "As AI continues to transform industries, companies are faced with the critical challenge of effectively monetizing AI-driven products in a way that captures value, ensures customer adoption, and scales revenue sustainably. Unlike traditional SaaS models, AI-powered products have unique complexities - such as fluctuating usage patterns, variable compute costs, and evolving customer demands, making conventional pricing strategies unhelpful to the growth of an AI product-led startup.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Alvaro Morales, CEO and co-founder of Orb, will explore why the often overlooked monetization aspect of AI is critical for businesses. He’ll share real-world examples and data to demonstrate how adaptive pricing models can drive cost savings, enhance customer experience, and reduce operational bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nAlvaro will lead a live demo, showcasing how engineers can simulate AI pricing strategies and subsequently integrate them with a simple plug-and-play solution. He’ll also share how real-world revenue simulations enable companies to test and refine pricing before implementing — reducing risk, boosting adoption, and unlocking new revenue streams. As a quick example, cloud software development platform Replit was looking to adopt a usage-based pricing model for a new product, but their existing billing system couldn't support the new model, and building a new billing system would delay the launch timeline. In order to get things done, they turned to Orb, which enabled them to make pricing changes up to the last minute. After the launch, Orb became the single source of truth for both Replit and its customers - providing usage alerts to notify Replit when users hit cost thresholds and provide insights into user spend and payment methods.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways: \r\nThe challenge of AI monetization – Why traditional subscription-based SaaS pricing models don’t work for AI-powered products.\r\nPrecision pricing – Exploring how usage-based, tiered, and hybrid pricing models can maximize revenue potential. \r\nRevenue simulation for AI pricing – Leveraging real-time data to test, adjust and optimize pricing strategies.\r\nAvoiding common pricing pitfalls – Identifying mistakes that can lead to revenue leakage and customer churn.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for AI executives, product leaders, and engineering teams looking for actionable strategies to build adaptive, scalable pricing models that drive long-term growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n",

The vision of an \"AI Co-scientist\" – a true collaborative partner in the lab – requires sophisticated engineering to bridge the gap between powerful AI reasoning and the dynamic reality of physical experiments. This talk dives into the engineering required to build robust AI Co-scientists for hands-on research. We will explore scalable architectures, such as multi-agent systems leveraging foundation models like Gemini for complex reasoning, hypothesis refinement (inspired by the \"generate, debate, evolve\" paradigm described in recent AI Co-scientist research), and intelligent tool use. The core focus will be on the engineering challenges and solutions for integrating diverse, real-time empirical data streams – visual data from cameras, quantitative readings from sensors, positional feedback from actuators, and instrument outputs – directly into the AI's reasoning loop. I will illustrate this with concrete, technically detailed examples in chemistry (adaptive reaction monitoring), robotics (vision-guided assembly with SO Arm 100 and LeRobot library), and synthetic biology (real-time bacterial growth monitoring & interpretation). We'll discuss engineering strategies for handling data heterogeneity, latency, noise, and enabling the AI to interpret, correlate, and act upon live experimental feedback. Finally, we will touch upon how thoughtful engineering of these AI Co-scientists can contribute to democratizing access to advanced scientific capabilities.\r\n",

Or is \"eval\" a third-party dataset run once to benchmark a model?\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this cacophony, this talk will provide an opinionated and principled perspective for what we actually mean when we say “evaluation”, beyond the traditional for-loop-over-a-static dataset. \r\n\r\nIn particular, this perspective draws heavy inspiration from *fuzzing*, i.e. bombarding AI with simulated, unexpected user inputs to uncover corner cases at scale. This factors into sub-problems regarding:\r\n\r\n- Quality Metric. What is the actual criteria we, as humans, are using to determine if an AI system is producing good or bad responses? How do we elicit these criteria before the human SME can articulate them? How do we, as efficiently as possible, operationalize this criteria with an automated *Judge*?\r\n\r\n- Stimuli Generation. Given a metric, how do we know, with confidence, that an AI system is performing well with respect to the metric? What data is representative and sufficient for discovering all potential bugs of an AI system? And how do we generate this complex, diverse, faithful data at scale? \r\n\r\nWe will discuss in detail the philosophy, technology, and case studies behind both problems of Quality Metric and Stimuli Generation, and how they interact in concert.",

In practice, this comes down to a handful of deeply technical questions:\r\n- How do you make sure agents are only acting for the right user?\r\n- How do you prevent over-broad API access or data leaks?\r\n- How do you handle user approvals when there is no UI, or you need a human in the loop?\r\n- And how do you avoid the usual pain points like manual credential sharing, stale keys, or unpredictable scopes without writing a lot of brittle, custom code?\r\n\r\nThis talk digs into the real technical trade-offs behind building secure, user-aware AI agents. We will go beyond what to do and explain why, sharing the architectural decisions, open standards, and hard lessons learned from integrating OAuth, OIDC, RAR, and async authorization into agent-driven workflows.\r\n\r\nYou will see a hands-on demo using an open-source Node.js agent and open protocols, with a focus on practical integration and no magic. The session will show how these solutions have shaped our approach to identity in GenAI and where we see the field heading next.\r\n\r\nIf you are an engineer building AI apps that need real guardrails, not just a happy-path demo, we hope to leave you with some practical patterns, design rationale, and a clear view of the trade-offs for making your own agents production ready.",

Whether automating workflows, integrating with APIs, or acting on behalf of users, AI-driven assistants and autonomous systems are becoming core product features. But securing these agents presents a fundamental challenge: How do you authenticate AI agents? How do you control what they can access? How do you ensure they act within the right permissions? This talk will explore these concepts and more while highlighting current research and best practices.",

This session synthesizes key patterns and practical strategies gathered from more than 200 GenAI implementations across multiple industries and business sizes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the general lessons that apply to most products leveraging GenAI, we'll cover detailed observations within three application areas: multimodal understanding and search, enterprise knowledge retrieval, and AI agent architectures. We will share real-world comparative performance data and metrics on embedding models, vector index implementations, and explore various implementation methodologies that balance performance and cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the session addresses organizational insights critical to successful AI deployments, such as the importance of clearly defined evaluation processes and understanding real-world user interaction challenges, highlighted by examples from healthcare environments. Attendees will gain an understanding of decision-making criteria, including the appropriate complexity of prompt engineering versus more elaborate orchestration methods, token/cost management strategies in multilingual settings, and the challenges in driving behavioral change with new UX and application interaction capabilities.\r\n\r\nParticipants will leave equipped with practical, data-supported insights for effectively navigating their own GenAI projects, including benchmarks and criteria for informed technology selection, and techniques to streamline the transition from initial concept to sustainable operational deployment.

      "description": "Software engineers have long understood that high-quality code requires comprehensive automated testing. For decades, our industry has relied on deterministic tests with clear pass/fail outcomes to ensure reliability. \r\n\r\nHigh-quality software depends on automated testing. That's certainly true at Zed, where we're building a next-generation native IDE in Rust. Zed runs at 120 frames per second, but it would also crash once a second if we didn't maintain and run a comprehensive suite of unit tests on every change.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when AI enters the equation?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore how continuous integration evolves when working with AI components. \"Evals\" - parlance from the machine learning field - are fundamentally a continuation of the software testing tradition, but with a critical difference: they're inherently stochastic.\r\n\r\nZed's traditional CI goes to extreme lengths to eliminate non-determinism, as nobody likes having their pull requests blocked by flaky builds. We've even fully simulated network interactions with a deterministic random scheduler. AI components, however, forced us to confront a fundamental paradigm shift—uncertainty isn't a bug but an intrinsic feature of these systems, compelling us to embrace what we couldn't avoid.\r\n\r\nWe'll share our journey of reconceptualizing evals as \"stochastic unit tests\" - still verifying system behavior, but without binary pass/fail grades.\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss practical approaches to:\r\n- Thoughtfully building test suites for AI components\r\n- Shifting from red/green outcomes to \"shades of gray\"\r\n- Replacing build gates with trend analysis and performance monitoring\r\n- Maintaining engineering confidence despite statistical variance\r\n\r\nWhether you're incorporating AI into existing systems or building new AI-powered tools, this talk will provide practical insights into maintaining quality when determinism gives way to probability.",

      "description": "[!!Subject to change!!]\r\n\r\nLarge models are trained through mountains of data and learned reward functions, yet - quis custodiet ipsos custodes? - what exactly are those amorphous blobs of data and rewards trying to specify? Building LLMs in any domain demands both clarity of thought and the skill to communicate those thoughts precisely - not only to other humans but to the models themselves. Without either, we risk unpleasant surprises.\r\n\r\nThis talk dives into:\r\n\t•\tWhy prompt spaghetti and data gumbo inevitably collapse at scale, unleashing behaviors we never intended - while a rigorously versioned spec keeps safety, personality, and UX firmly aligned, and makes incidents easier and faster to diagnose and fix.\r\n\t•\tHow OpenAI’s public Model Spec provides a clear template, complemented by emerging “dev tools” that turn hazy human intent into precise, human-and-machine-readable policy.\r\n\t•\tHow deliberative alignment training teaches models to first read and reason about the spec, boosting robustness without inflating context windows.\r\n\t•\tPractical tactics for catching ambiguity, untangling contradictions, and preserving global consistency. Plus, techniques for verifying that deployed models truly follow the contract we crafted.\r\n\r\nResources: Model Spec (2025‑04‑11) and Deliberative Alignment, Guan et al., 2024.",
